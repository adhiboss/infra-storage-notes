# Day 01 - RAID Basics

RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disks

RAID 0 → Striping (Performance, No redundancy)
RAID 1 → Mirroring (Redundancy)
RAID 5 → Striping + Parity (Fault tolerance)
RAID 6 → Double parity
RAID 10 → Mirror + Striping

Use case:
Enterprise storage systems
Backup appliances
Datacenter disks
